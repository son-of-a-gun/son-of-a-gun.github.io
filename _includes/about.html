                <h2>About Son of a Gun</h2>
                <p>Located in the rainy Pacific Northwest, we have worked hard to prove that even us Washingtonians can produce a damn good bbq.</p>
                <p>Our company, The Spice Hut, has been producing custom and original blends and spices for nearly 15 years, and this has been an important process for us to establish Son of a Gun, a fun and whimsical take on wild west grilling, and loaded with more flavor than you could imagine.</p>

                  <h3>Flat Iron Steak</h3>
                  <br>
                  <p>Herby, natural flavors in the first bite. Works well as a meat tenderizer, the saltiness is absorbed to produce a juicy outcome. This versatile seasoning works well with all meat types and all occasions. </p>

                  <h3>Reserve Blend</h3>
                  <br>
                  <p> Sweet and spicy flavor. A brown sugar base makes food have a refreshing sweet taste, and the cayenne pepper gives a mild kick to the meal. Lower in sodium. The smokey after tones in this rub are great for grilling. </p>

                  <br>
                  <p>A mild southwest flavor packed with rich ingredients and a bit of vest for next level barbecuing. A well rounded, all-purpose seasoning great for quick and easy cooking. </p>
